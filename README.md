# Happy Movie Jokes ðŸŽ¥

Welcome to the Happy Movie Jokes repository! This application combines entertainment and technology by leveraging the MovieDB API to fetch top trending movies and integrates ChatGPT 3.5 to generate movie-based jokes according to user-defined rules.

## Application Overview

Happy Movie Jokes is designed to provide users with a fun experience by allowing them to explore top trending movies and enjoy custom-tailored jokes about each. Using a combination of Chakra UI for a sleek user interface and Redux for efficient state management, the app offers a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Highlights

- **Trending Movies**: Browse through a list of current top trending movies.
- **Custom Jokes**: Users can set custom rules for generating jokes (or use pre-defined rule), which ChatGPT 3.5 then uses to create humor based on the selected movie.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilize Chakra UI components for a responsive and accessible design.
